## [4.0.2] - 31-Aug-2022

### Bugfixes
- Stress solver Linux crash fix.  Explicitly allocating aligned data buffers for use with simd data.


## [4.0.1] - 10-Aug-2022

### Bugfixes
- Stress solver fixes:
  - More robust conversion from angular pressures to linear pressures.
  - Better error tolerance checking.
  - Force sign consistency.


## [4.0.0] - 31-May-2022

### New Features
- Fully integrated stress-damage system.  A stress solver is used to determine how bond forces react to impacts and other externally-supplied accelerations.
Stress limits (elastic and fatal) determine how bond health (area) deteriorates with bond force.  When bonds break and new actors are generated,
excess forces are applied to the previously joined bodies.  Using a new stress solver with better convergence properties.
- Documentation publishing.

  - Ability to pass chunk connectivity info to uniteChunks function, enabling chunks split by island detection to  be united.

## [1.1.0] - 2017-08-28

### Changes
- VC12 is no longer supported.
- New license header, consistent with PhysX license header.
- New serialization extension.  NvBlastExtSerialization is now a modular serialization manager.  It loads serializers sets for low-level, Tk, and ExtPx.  Each serializer handles a particular file format and object type.  Currently the universally available format for all object types is Cap'n Proto binary.  The file format is universal, as it uses a header to inform the serialization manager which serializer is needed to deserialize the contained data.  All authoring and import tools write using this format to files with a ".blast" filename extension.
- Corresponding to the new serialization, the old formats have been deprecated.  In particular, the DataConverter tool has been removed.  Instead see LegacyConverter in the ### New Features section.
- TkSerializable virtual base class has been removed.  TkAsset and TkFamily are now derived directly from TkIdentifiable.  Serialization functions have been removed, replaced by the new serialization extension.
- ExtPxAsset serialization functions have been removed, replaced by the new serialization extension.
- World bonds.  A bond descriptor can now take the invalid index for one of its chunkIndices.  This will cause an additional support graph node to be created within an asset being created with this descriptor.  This node will not correspond to any chunk (it maps to the invalid index in the graph's chunkIndices array).  Actors that contain this new "world node" may be kept static by the user, emulating world attachment.  This is easily tested using the new low-level function NvBlastActorIsBoundToWorld.
- With the addition of world bonds (see above), the NvBlastExtImport extension no longer creates an extra "earth chunk" to bind chunks to the world.  Instead, it creates world bonds.
- ExtPxAsset now contains an NvBlastActorDesc, which is used as the default actor descriptor when creating an ExtPxFamily from the asset.
- TkFramework no longer has its own allocator and message handler.  Instead, this is part of a new NvBlastGlobals API.  This way, extensions and TkFramework may share the same allocator.
- SampleAssetViewer
  - Physics simulation now runs concurrently with graphics and some of the sample/blast logic.
  - New Damage tool added: line segment damage
  - Damage tool radius can be set individually for each tool (radial, cutter, line segment, hierarchical).
  - Cubes now removed when a scene is reloaded.
  - Cube throw velocity can be "charged" by holding down the 'F' key.
- New damage system built around "health," see API ### changes in NvBlastExtShaders and ### changes in NvBlastExtImpactDamageManager.
- NvBlastExtShearGraphShader uses a chunk-based method to find the closest graph node, improving performance.
- TkGroup no longer uses physx::PxTaskManager interface for task management.  Instead, a TkGroupWorker interface has been added.  The NvBlastExtPhysX extension uses the physx::PxTaskManager to implement this interface.
- Better error handling in AuthoringTool (stderr and user error handler).
- More consistent commandline switches in AuthoringTool and ApexImporter (--ll, --tk, --px flags).
- Various small clean-ups.

### New Features
- NvBlastExtAssetUtils extension
  - Merge multiple assets into one.
  - Add "world bonds" to an asset (see "World bonds" in the ### Changes section).
  - Transform an NvBlastAsset's geometric data in-place.
- NvBlastExtAuthoring
  - Open edge detection.
  - Rotation of voronoi cells used for fracturing.
- "Globals" code (under sdk/globals).  Includes a global allocator, message handler, and profiler API used by TkFramework and extensions.
- NvBlastExtStress extension, a PhysX-independent API for performing stress calculations with low-level Blast actors.
- NvBlastActorIsSplitRequired() function for low-level actors.  If this function returns false, NvBlastActorSplit() may be skipped as it will have no effect.
- NvBlastExtShaders
  - New "Segment Radial Damage" shader.  Damages everything within a given distance of a line segment.
- New NvBlastExtExporter extension, used commonly by import and authoring tools.  Allows collision data to be stored in one of three ways:
  - JSON format.
  - FBX mesh format (seprate file).
  - FBX mesh format in a second "collision" layer, alongside the graphics mesh nodes corresponding to Blast chunks.
- LegacyConverter tool has been added, which converts .llasset, .tkasset, .bpxa, .pllasset, .ptkasset, and .pbpxa asset files to the new .blast format using the universal serialization scheme in the new NvBlastExtSerialization extension.
- NvBlastExtAuthoring
  - Mesh cleaner, tries to remove self intersections and open edges in the interior of a mesh.
  - Ability to set interior material to existing (external) material, or a new material id.
  - Material ID remapping API.

### Bug Fixes
- NvBlastExtAuthoring
  - Slicing normals fix.
- Various instances of &array[0] to get the data buffer from a std::vector now use data() member function.  This had led to some crashes with empty vectors.
- SampleAssetViewer
  - Fixed dragging kinematic actor.
  - Now loads the commandline-defined asset also when sample resources were not downloaded yet.
- Serialization documented.
- Fixed smoothing groups in FBX exporter code.
- Impulse passing from parent to child chunks fixed.
- Reading unskinned fbx meshes correctly.
- Collision hull generation from fbx meshes fixed.
- Win32/64 PerfTest crash fix.

### Known Issues
- Damage shaders in extensions can miss bonds if the damage volume is too small.
- Authoring extension does not perform convex decomposition to fit chunks with multiple collision hulls.
- Authoring code does not use the user-defined allocator (NvBlastGlobals) exclusively.
