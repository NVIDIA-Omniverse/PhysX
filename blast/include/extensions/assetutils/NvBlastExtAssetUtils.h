/**
Creates an asset descriptor which will build an asset that merges several assets.  Each asset (or component)
is given a transform, applied to the geometric information in the chunk and bond descriptors.

New bond descriptors may be given to bond support chunks from different components.

An NvBlastAsset may appear more than once in the components array.

This function will call NvBlastEnsureAssetExactSupportCoverage on the returned chunk descriptors.  It will also
call NvBlastReorderAssetDescChunks if the user passes in valid arrays for chunkReorderMap and chunkReorderMapSize.
Otherwise, the user must ensure that the returned chunk descriptors are in a valid order is valid before using them.

NOTE: This function allocates memory using the allocator in NvBlastGlobals, to create the new chunk and bond
descriptor arrays referenced in the returned NvBlastAssetDesc.  The user must free this memory after use with
NVBLAST_FREE appied to the pointers in the returned NvBlastAssetDesc.

\param[in]  components          An array of assets to merge, of size componentCount.
\param[in]  scales              An array of scales to apply to the geometric data in the chunks and bonds.
                                If NULL, no scales are applied.  If not NULL, the array must be of size componentCount.
\param[in]  rotations           An array of rotations to apply to the geometric data in the chunks and bonds,
                                stored quaternion format. The quaternions MUST be normalized.  If NULL, no rotations are applied.
                                If not NULL, the array must be of size componentCount.
\param[in]  translations        An array of translations to apply to the geometric data in the chunks and bonds.
                                If NULL, no translations are applied.  If not NULL, the array must be of size componentCount.
\param[in]  componentCount      The size of the components and relativeTransforms arrays.
\param[in]  newBondDescs        Descriptors of type NvBlastExtAssetUtilsBondDesc for new bonds between components, of size newBondCount.  If NULL, newBondCount must be 0.
\param[in]  newBondCount        The size of the newBondDescs array.
\param[in]  chunkIndexOffsets   If not NULL, must point to a uin32_t array of size componentCount.  It will be filled with the starting elements in chunkReorderMap corresponding to
                                each component.
\param[in]  chunkReorderMap     If not NULL, the returned descriptor is run through NvBlastReorderAssetDescChunks, to ensure that it is a valid asset descriptor.  In the process, chunks
                                may be reordered (in addition to their natural re-indexing due to them all being placed in one array).  To map from the old chunk indexing for the various
                                component assets to the chunk indexing used in the returned descriptor, set chunkReorderMap to point to a uin32_t array of size equal to the total number
                                of chunks in all components, and pass in a non-NULL value to chunkIndexOffsets as described above.  Then, for component index c and chunk index k within
                                that component, the new chunk index is given by: index = chunkReorderMap[ k + chunkIndexOffsets[c] ].
\param[in]  chunkReorderMapSize The size of the array passed into chunkReorderMap, if chunkReorderMap is not NULL.  This is for safety, so that this function does not overwrite chunkReorderMap.

\return an asset descriptor that will build an asset which merges the components, using NvBlastCreateAsset.
