/**
Interface to a "cutout set," used with chippable fracturing.  A cutout set is created from a bitmap.  The
result is turned into cutouts which are applied to the mesh.  For example, a bitmap which looks like a brick
pattern will generate a cutout for each "brick," forming the cutout set.

Each cutout is a 2D entity, meant to be projected onto various faces of a mesh.  They are represented
by a set of 2D vertices, which form closed loops.  More than one loop may represent a single cutout, if
the loops are forced to be convex.  Otherwise, a cutout is represented by a single loop.
