Load all low-level serializers into the ExtSerialization manager.  *N.B.* This is done automatically when
the ExtSerialization manager is created via NvBlastExtSerializationCreate(), so currently this public function
is unnecessary.  Note also that other modules' serializers (e.g. ExtTkSerialization) are _not_ loaded
automatically, and need to be explicitly loaded by the user using their respective load functions.

It does no harm to call this function more than once; serializers already loaded will not be loaded again.
