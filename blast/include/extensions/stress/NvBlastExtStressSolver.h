/**
Stress Solver Settings

Stress on every bond is calculated with these components:
    compression/tension (parallel to bond normal)
    shear (perpendicular to bond normal)
Damage is done based on the limits defined in this structure to simulate micro bonds in the material breaking
Units for all limits are in pascals

Support graph reduction:
graphReductionLevel is the number of node merge passes.  The resulting graph will be
roughly 2^graphReductionLevel times smaller than the original.
NOTE: the reduction is currently fairly random and can lead to interlocked actors when solver bonds break.
If we are going to keep the feature, the algorithm for combining bonds should be revisited to take locality into account.

/**
Stress Solver.

Uses NvBlastFamily, allocates and prepares its graph once when it's created. Then it's being quickly updated on every
actor split.
It uses NvBlastAsset support graph, you can apply forces on nodes and stress on bonds will be calculated as the result.
When stress on bond exceeds it's health bond is considered broken (overstressed).
Basic usage:
1. Create it with create function once for family
2. Fill node info for every node in support graph or use setAllNodesInfoFromLL() function.
3. Use notifyActorCreated / notifyActorDestroyed whenever actors are created and destroyed in family.
4. Every frame: Apply forces (there are different functions for it see @addForce)
5. Every frame: Call update() for actual solver to process.
6. If getOverstressedBondCount() > 0 use generateFractureCommands() functions to get FractureCommands with bonds fractured
