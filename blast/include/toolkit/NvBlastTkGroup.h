A group is a processing unit, to which the user may add TkActors.  New actors generated from splitting a TkActor
are automatically put into the same group.  However, any actor may be removed from its group and placed into
another group (or no group) by the user's choice.

When the group's process function is called, all actors' damage buffers will be processed and turned into fracture events
and the actor is split if applicable.

This work can be done in multiple threads with the help of TkGroupWorker:  
Instead of calling the process function, commence the procedure with startProcess which returns the number of jobs to process.  
Each concurrent thread uses an acquired TkGroupWorker to process the jobs.
Over the whole procedure, each job must be processed once and only once.  
Jobs can be processed in any order.  TkGroupWorkers can be returned and acquired later by another task.
After processing every job and returning all the workers to the group, endProcess concludes the procedure.
