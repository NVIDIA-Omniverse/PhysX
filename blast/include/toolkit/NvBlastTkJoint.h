/**
The TkJoint is may join two different TkActors, or be created internally within a single TkActor.

When a TkActor is created from a TkAsset with jointed bonds (the asset is created using a TkAssetDesc with joint flags on bonds, see TkActorDesc) then
internal TkJoint objects are created and associated with every TkActor created from that TkAsset.  The user only gets notification of the internal TkJoint
objects when the TkActor is split into separate TkActor objects that hold the support chunks joined by an internal TkJoint.

The user will be notified when the TkActor objects that are attached to TkJoint objects change, or are released.  In that case, a TkEvent with
a TkJointUpdateEvent payload is dispatched to TkEventListener objects registered with the TkFamily objects to which the actors belong.
