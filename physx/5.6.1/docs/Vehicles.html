<p>PhysX support for vehicles has been significantly reworked in 5.1. More specifically, a new system of flexible vehicle components has been introduced.  Components may be mixed, matched and customised to create different types of vehicle that may be simulated at different levels of computational complexity.</p>
<p>It is straightforward to recreate all of the drive models that were implemented in the legacy classes PxVehicleNoDrive, PxVehicleDrive4W, PxVehicleDriveNW and PxVehicleDriveTank without further modification to any component maintained by the Vehicle SDK.  The difference now is that users are not limited to these drive models but instead may reuse components maintained by the Vehicle SDK in conjunction with custom components to create entirely new types of vehicle.</p>
<p>The fundamental physical models employed by the Vehicle SDK are largely unchanged. A number of bug fixes and improvements, however, have been made along the way. Where possible, legacy implementation is provided as an alternative to the standard implementation of the new Vehicle SDK.  These legacy components are clearly labelled and are marked as deprecated with a planned removal in a future release.</p>

<p>The PhysX Vehicle SDK models vehicles as collections of sprung masses, where each sprung mass represents a suspension line with associated wheel and tire data.  These collections of sprung masses have a complementary representation as a rigid body whose mass, center of mass, and moment of inertia matches exactly the masses and coordinates of the sprung masses.  This is illustrated below.</p>

<p>The relationship between the sprung mass and rigid body vehicle representations can be mathematically formalized with the rigid body center of mass equations:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where M1 and M2 are the sprung masses; X1 and X2 are the sprung mass coordinates in the rigid body frame; and M is the rigid body mass.</p>
<p>The components of the PhysX Vehicle compute the suspension and tire forces using the sprung mass model and then forward integrate the aggregate of these forces applied to the vehicle’s rigid body representation.</p>
<p>The update of each vehicle begins with a scene query for each suspension in order to determine the road geometry plane under each wheel.  The query begins at the pose of the wheel at maximum compression and casts downwards along the direction of suspension travel to the position of the wheel at maximum droop.  This is shown in the diagram below.</p>
<figure class="align-center" id="id12">
<a class="reference internal image-reference" href="../_images/VehicleSceneQuery.png"><img alt="../_images/VehicleSceneQuery.png" src="../_images/VehicleSceneQuery.png" style="width: 802.8000000000001px; height: 481.5px;" />

</figure>
<p>The suspension force from each elongated or compressed spring is computed and added to the aggregate force to be applied to the rigid body.  Additionally, the suspension force is used to compute the load that is bearing down on the tire. This load is used to determine the tire forces that will be generated in the contact plane and then added to the aggregate force to be applied to the rigid body.  The tire force computation actually depends on a number of factors including steer angle, camber angle, friction, wheel rotation speed, and rigid body momentum.  The aggregated force of all tire and suspension forces is then applied to the vehicle’s rigid body and forward integrated.  Integration with the PhysX scene is achieved by creating an PxRigidBody instance and setting its linear and angular  velocities to be the values held by the vehicle’s rigid body.  The PhysX scene forward integrates the geometry and momentum of the PxRigidBody instance and manages rigid body contacts that occur between the vehicle and the rest of the PhysX scene.  The pose and momentum of the PxRigidBody instance is then passed to the vehicle’s rigid body for the next vehicle simulation step.</p>
<p>In addition to being collections of sprung masses, PhysX vehicles also support a variety of drive models.  The center of the drive model is a torsion clutch, which couples together the wheels and the engine via forces that arise from differences in rotational speeds at both sides of the clutch.  At one side of the clutch is the engine, which is powered directly from the accelerator pedal.  The engine is modeled as a rigid body whose motion is purely rotational and limited to a single degree of rotational freedom.   At the other side of the clutch are the gearing system, the differential and the wheels.  The effective rotational speed of the other side of the clutch can be computed directly from the gearing ratio and the rotational speed of the wheels that are coupled to the clutch through the differential.  This model naturally allows engine torques to propagate to the wheels and wheel torques to propagate back to the engine.</p>

<p>Custom combinations of parameter, state and component allow different behaviours to be simulated with different simulation fidelities.  For example, a suspension component that implements a linear force response with respect to its compression state could be replaced with one that imlements a non-linear response.  The replacement component would consume the same suspension compression state data and would output the same suspension force data structure.  In this example, the change has been localised to the component that converts suspension compression to force and to the parameterisation that governs that conversion.  Another combination example could be the replacement of the tire component from a low fidelity model to a high fidelty model such as Pacejka. The low and high fidelity components consume the same state data (tire slip, load, friction) and  output the same state data for the tire forces. Again, the change has been localised to the component that converts slip angle to tire force and the parameterisation that governs the conversion.</p>
</section>
<section id="commands">
<span id="software-architecture-commands"></span><h3>Commands<a class="headerlink" href="#commands" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>There are two types of command:  universal commands that are applied to all vehicles and transmission commands that are unique to each vehicle type.</p>
<p>Vehicles are controlled by normalised parameters indicating the state of the throttle pedal, the brake pedal, the handbrake and the steering wheel. These are the universal commands that are common to all vehicle types supported by the Vehicle SDK.  It is worth noting that the brake and the handbrake both apply brake torques to wheels.  As a consequence, the brake and the handbrake are combined into an array of brake values. Each brake value in the array may be configured as a brake or as a handbrake by configuring brake response parameters for each type of brake.  Alternatively, each brake value in the array may be used to simulate the left and right brake levers of a tank.  The interpretation of any command, be that steering wheel or throttle or brake, depends on the sequence of components and functions that consume the commands.</p>
<p>Transmission commands are unique to each type of drive. For example, direct drive mode has a single command for forward, reverse or neutral gear.  The gearing selected acts as a multiplier that is applied to the available drive torque before distributing torque to the driven wheels.  Engine drive mode, on the other hand, has a command that either engages automatic gear or instantiates a gear change.  It also has a clutch command that engages and disengages the clutch.  Tank drive not only supports gear changes and clutch control but also has two thrust commands that simulate left and right thrust levers that distribute available drive torque to the wheels of the left and right tank tracks.</p>
<p>Universal commands are implemented with the following struct:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference internal" href="../_api_build/structPxVehicleCommandState.html#_CPPv421PxVehicleCommandState" title="PxVehicleCommandState"><code class="xref cpp cpp-struct docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">PxVehicleCommandState</span></code></a></p></li>

<p>Transmission commands are implemented by the following structs:</p>

</ul>

<section id="parameters">
<span id="software-architecture-parameters"></span><h3>Parameters<a class="headerlink" href="#parameters" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Parameters describe the configuration of the vehicle and the physics model employed. Examples are vehicle mass, wheel radius and suspension stiffness.  Parameters remain constant throughout a single simulation step.</p>
</section>
<section id="states">
<span id="software-architecture-states"></span><h3>States<a class="headerlink" href="#states" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>States describe the instantaneous dynamic state of a vehicle.  Examples are engine revs, wheel yaw angle and tire slip angles.  Each simulation step will update the state data of a vehicle.</p>
</section>
<section id="c-functions">
<span id="software-architecture-c-functions"></span><h3>C Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#c-functions" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The Vehicle SDK ships with a maintained set of C functions.  These functions are invoked by components to perform the computation required to update a vehicle.</p>
</section>
<section id="components">
<span id="software-architecture-components"></span><h3>Components<a class="headerlink" href="#components" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>Components forward integrate the dynamic state of the vehicle, given command inputs, the previous vehicle state and the vehicle’s parameterisation.  Components update dynamic state by invoking reusable C functions in a particular sequence. An example component is a rigid body component that forward integrates the linear and angular velocity of the vehicle’s rigid body given the instantaneous forces and torques of the suspension and tire states.</p>
<p>Components are typically designed to reflect human-level understanding of the constituent parts of a vehicle’s mechanical model. Tire force computation serves as an example. Computing a tire force involves a series of function calls to compute the tire slips and to convert the tire slips into forces. It makes sense to abstract this sequence of function calls into a single unit.</p>
<p>Each component is a sub-class of PxVehicleComponent, an interface class with a single pure virtual function:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">virtual</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nf">PxVehicleComponent::update</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">PxReal</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">dt</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">PxVehicleSimulationContext</span><span class="o">&amp;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">context</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Each component maintained by the Vehicle SDK implements the update() function and introduces one more pure virtual function.  This virtual function gathers all of the command, parameter and state data required by the sequence of C functions that will be executed by the component.  The idea here is that vehicles may employ any data layout, provided that layout can fulfil the requirements of the virtual function. This is discussed in more detail in Sections <a class="reference internal" href="#snippets-vehicle-design-pattern"><span class="std std-ref">Vehicle Design Pattern</span></a> and <a class="reference internal" href="#data-layout"><span class="std std-ref">Parameter and State Data Layout</span></a>. Custom components may follow this pattern or may directly store pointers and references to parameter and state data in the custom component class instances.</p>
<p>A vehicle update is performed by updating a sequence of components in a defined order.</p>
</section>
<section id="component-sequences">
<span id="software-architecture-component-sequences"></span><h3>Component Sequences<a class="headerlink" href="#component-sequences" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The pipeline of vehicle computation is a sequence of components that run in a defined order.  For example, one component might compute the plane under the wheel by performing a scene query against the world geometry. The next component in the sequence might compute the suspension compression required to place the wheel on the surface of the hit plane. Following this, a subsequent component might compute the suspension force that arises from that compression.  The rigid body component, as discussed in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#mechanical-model"><span class="std std-ref">Mechanical Model</span></a>, can then forward integrate the rigid body’s linear velocity using the suspension force.</p>
<p>The class PxVehicleComponentSequence allows component sequences to be defined and updated.</p>
<p>Components are added according to the order of execution:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">PxVehicleComponentSequence</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sequence</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Chains of subsequent components may be grouped together into sub-stepping groups within the component sequence.  Each sub-stepping group of components will be updated in order an integer number of times with a timestep that reflects the number of updates.  This allows small timesteps to be directed at the numerically stiffest parts of the simulation without the computational cost of simulating the entire pipeline at a small timestep.  The following pseudo-code demonstrates a substepping group of two components ComponentMiddle1 and ComponentMiddle2 that will be updated 3 times per sequence update:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">PxVehicleComponentSequence</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sequence</span><span class="p">;</span>

<p>It is worth noting that sub-stepping groups may be nested.</p>
<p>A vehicle simulation step is invoked by calling the following function:</p>

<p>The Vehicle SDK imposes no rules on data layout and instead supports any mixture of struct-of-array and array-of-struct layouts.  This is achieved using the following related structs to communicate arrays of parameter and state data to components:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">template</span><span class="o">&lt;</span><span class="k">typename</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">T</span><span class="o">&gt;</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="k">struct</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">PxVehicleArrayData</span><span class="p">;</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>PxVehicleArrayData and PxVehicleSizedArrayData allow arrays of parameter and state data to be specified as a contiguous array of instances or as an array of pointers to instances.</p>
<p>The struct PxVehicleArrayData is used when there is one instance (or pointer to instance) per wheel.  The number of wheels is already encoded in PxVehicleAxleDescription so there is no need to repeat the wheel count in the array.</p>
<p>The struct PxVehicleSizedArrayData is used for parameter and state data that is not specified per wheel.  An example might be anti-roll bar parameters. A vehicle may have any number of anti-roll bars connecting any combination of wheel pairs.  The number of anti-roll bars is communicated to the relevant components by encoding the count in the struct PxVehicleSizedArrayData.</p>

<span id="id5"></span><h2>PhysX Scene Integration<a class="headerlink" href="#physx-scene-integration" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h2>
<p>PhysX Vehicles may be configured so that the vehicle is independent of a PhysX scene or they may be configured with a complementary PhysX actor added to a PhysX scene that manages collisions with other PhysX actors.</p>
<section id="pxvehiclephysxactorbegincomponent-and-pxvehiclephysxendbegincomponent">

<p>PhysX scene integration is primarily accomplished with two components that typically run as the first and last component in the component sequence. These components are PxVehiclePhysXActorBeginComponent and  PxVehiclePhysXActorEndComponent.  The class PxVehiclePhysXActorBeginComponent is responsible for reading the rigid body state from the PhysX actor and writing that state to the vehicle’s own rigid body. This typically executes after a PxScene update and at the beginning of the next component sequence update.  The class PxVehiclePhysXActorEndComponent is responsible for writing the vehicle’s own rigid body state to the PhysX Actor.  This typically executes at the end of the component sequence update and prior to the next PxScene update.</p>
<p>In the absence of any PhysX integration, the component update order may be represented as follows:</p>

<span id="physx-scene-constraint"></span><h3>PxVehiclePhysXConstraintComponent<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehiclephysxconstraintcomponent" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The class PxVehiclePhysXConstraintComponent is designed to feed custom constraint data to the PhysX scene so that breaches of suspension limit and sticky tire states may be resolved with custom PhysX joints.   It typically executes after the tire and suspension components for reasons that shall soon become clear.</p>
<p>If the vehicle encounters a sudden change in road geometry, it often happens that the wheel may only be placed on the ground by exceeding the maximum compression of the suspension. The solution is to clamp the wheel’s motion to the position at maximum compression and to resolve the discrepancy with a custom constraint applied to the vehicle’s associated PhysX actor.  The constraint will push the vehicle upwards with a velocity that attempts to resolve the discrepancy in the next simulate step of the PhysX scene.</p>
<p>The “sticky tire” state is a simulation mode that triggers at low longitudinal and lateral speed. An observation here is that the tire model has a tendency towards instability and oscillation at low speed. This makes it difficult to bring the vehicle smoothly to rest, particularly with larger simulation timesteps.  A solution to this is to replace the tire forces with custom PhysX joints that act as velocity constraints and serve to bring the vehicle smoothly to rest over multiple timsteps.  When the longitudinal and lateral speeds of any tire are below a threshold speed for more than a threshold time, the tire will enter the sticky state and the tire force will be replaced with velocity constraints applied to the vehicle’s associated PhysX actor.</p>
<p>If there is no associated PhysX actor, it is not possible to resolve suspension discrepancies or enforce velocity constraints. The constraint data will be calculated by the standard vehicle components maintained by the Vehicle SDK but there will be no way to forward that data to either a PhysX actor or to the PhysX scene.  If there is a suspension discrepancy then the wheel will remain below the ground plane. If a tire enters the sticky tire state then there will be no tire force applied  but also no system of velocity reduction to bring the vehicle to rest.  These issues have a variety of solutions.</p>
<p>One solution to the sticky tire problem  is to simulate with small timesteps at low speed by either using a small timestep or multiple substeps, as discussed in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#software-architecture-component-sequences"><span class="std std-ref">Component Sequences</span></a>. If this approach is chosen, it is important to deactivate the sticky tire completely to ensure that tire forces are always applied.  This is achieved by setting the threshold speeds of the sticky tire state to 0.0:</p>

<p>Small timesteps may also be used to resolve breaches of the suspension limit. This may be coupled with a custom suspension component that introduces a stiff and nonlinear spring that mimics the effect of a suspension bump stop.  Such a spring would typically generate zero force below a threshold of suspension compression. The force would typically increase rapidly and nonlinearly as the compression approaches the maximum.  With sufficiently small timesteps or targeted substeps, it may be possible to avoid reaching the end of a vehicle component sequence update with any portion of the wheel visibly inside the ground plane.</p>
<p>Other approaches involve custom components that replace the roles played by the PhysX actor and scene.  One example, might be an integration with an alternative physics engine. Another example might be a custom component that implements a special tire model designed for the sticky state. Yet another might be a component that resolves breaches of suspension compression limit by formulating the breaches as a linear complementarity problem.</p>

<span id="physx-scene-queries"></span><h3>PxVehiclePhysXRoadGeometrySceneQueryComponent<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehiclephysxroadgeometryscenequerycomponent" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The class PxVehiclePhysXRoadGeometrySceneQueryComponent performs raycasts and sweeps against the geometry of a PhysX scene in order to determine the road geometry plane under each wheel. It is worth noting that this component does not require the  vehicle  to have a PhysX actor that is added to a PxScene.  All that is required is that there is a PxScene and that the vehicle is expected to drive on geometry in the scene.</p>
<p>The class PxVehiclePhysXRoadGeometrySceneQueryComponent may be replaced by any component that can compute a plane and a friction value for each wheel.  Provided the component writes to instances of PxVehicleRoadGeometryState, it will be a perfect replacement for PxVehiclePhysXRoadGeometrySceneQueryComponent.  Moreover, if the plane is constant and known there is no real need for any component at all.  All that would be required would be to perform one write to each PxVehicleRoadGeometryState instance to set the plane and friction for the duration of the simulation.</p>

<p>Section <a class="reference internal" href="#introduction"><span class="std std-ref">Introduction</span></a> noted that the legacy classes PxVehicleNoDrive, PxVehicleDrive4W, PxVehicleDriveNW and PxVehicleDriveTank may be recreated using vehicle  components that ship with the PhysX Vehicle SDK.</p>
<section id="pxvehiclenodrive">
<h3>PxVehicleNoDrive<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehiclenodrive" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The legacy class PxVehicleNoDrive had no drivetrain and instead applied user-supplied drive and brake torque to each wheel. This type of drive is now referred to as “direct drive” in the Vehicle SDK.  The configurability of the update pipeline opens up a number of options.  For example, by specifying a maximum torque and a per wheel torque multiplier, it is straightforward to create a vehicle that reacts linearly to a throttle command. Front wheel drive may be implemented by setting the wheel torque multipliers to 0.0 for the rear wheels and 1.0 for the front wheels.  Nonlinear reactions are also permissible with custom components that deliver torque to wheels according to any nonlinear function that accounts for forward speed, pedal response or even a notional engine temperature.  In each of these approaches, instantaneous commands and constant parameters are combined to write to vehicle state data that stores either the instantaneous torque to apply to each wheel or instantaneous state data that allows a torque to be computed and applied, according to a rule encoded in the component.  An even more direct approach is to simply write per wheel drive torques or yaw angles or brake torques to the relevant state data prior to each vehicle update.  This final approach is the closest to PxVehicleNoDrive.</p>

<section id="pxvehicledrive4w">
<h3>PxVehicleDrive4W<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehicledrive4w" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The legacy class PxVehicleDrive4W supported a full drivetrain model with engine, clutch, gears and a limited slip differential that could deliver drive torque to four wheels. This type of drive is now referred to as “Engine Drive” in the Vehicle SDK with different drive models corresponding to different types of differential. Choosing the differential component that is the equivalent of the legacy limited slip differential implements an engine drive model that is the equivalent of PxVehicleDrive4W.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the equivalent limited slip differential now supports delivery of drive torque to any number of wheels but with limited slip applied a maximum of four wheels.</p>

<section id="pxvehicledrivenw">
<h3>PxVehicleDriveNW<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehicledrivenw" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The legacy class PxVehicleDriveNW supported a full drivetrain model with engine, clutch, gears and a differential that delivered an equal torque to all driven wheels. This type of drive is now referred to as “Engine Drive” in the Vehicle SDK with different drive models corresponding to different types of differential.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the equivalent differential now supports any torque split rather than just an equal torque split between all  driven wheels.  It is straightforward to configure the differential to deliver an equal torque split, if so required.</p>

<h3>PxVehicleDriveTank<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehicledrivetank" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The legacy class PxVehicleDriveTank supported a full drivetrain model with engine, clutch, gears and a special tank differential. Torque was diverted by the differential  to the wheels to impose the rule that wheels sharing a tank track all had the same rotational speed.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting that the equivalent differential now supports any number of tank tracks rather than just a single left track and a single right track.</p>

<p>To save space, the table above employs a shorthand for the naming convention of each component in each sequence.  For example, the table entry EngineDriveActuationState is a shorthand for the class PxVehicleEngineDriveActuationStateComponent. Likewise, EngineDrivetrain is a shorthand for the class PxVehicleEngineDrivetrainComponent.  This pattern is repeated throughout the table.</p>
<p>Inspection of the table above reveals that the implementation of PxVehicleNoDrive requires no differential component.  The reason here is that the distribution of drive torque to wheels is already managed by PxVehicleDirectDriveCommandResponseComponent.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that some components are presented in an updated form with fixes and improvements. A consequence of this is that legacy behaviour is not guaranteed.  However, an outcome very close to legacy behaviour may be achieved by swapping a small number of components in the pipeline with their legacy equivalent. The following table illustrates the relationship between standard and legacy components:</p>

<span id="snippets-vehicle-design-pattern"></span><h3>Vehicle Design Pattern<a class="headerlink" href="#vehicle-design-pattern" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>The vehicle snippets employ a pattern that allows a flexible data layout. The basic idea is that a vehicle is encapsulated in a single class that inherits from all component types necessary to simulate the vehicle.  It is not necessary to follow this pattern but it is anticipated that many developers will wish to encapsulate each distinct vehicle model as a distinct class.</p>
<p>In order to clearly demonstrate the pattern, the example introduced in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#software-architecture-component-sequences"><span class="std std-ref">Component Sequences</span></a> is expanded in pseudo-code form.  In this example, there are three components labelled ComponentBegin, ComponentMiddle and ComponentEnd that are to run in sequence. A vehicle class MyVehicle inherits from all three components and stores all parameter and state data required for an instance of the vehicle:</p>

<p>A key point to note is that it is not necessary for the class MyVehicle to store parameter and state data.  All that is required is that parameter and state data may be gathered in the implementation of the functions getDataForComponentBegin(), getDataForComponentMiddle() and getDataForComponentEnd().  This allows, for example, parameter data to be shared by multiple vehicle instances.  An alternative implementation might store all parameter and state data in a struct of arrays or an array of structs external to the MyVehicle class with each MyVehicle instance maintaining an index into those arrays. Any data layout is achievable provided that the functions getDataForComponentBegin() etc are able to retrieve the necessary data.</p>
<p>Another point worth noting is that it is not necessary for MyVehicle to inherit from the component classes. This pattern is offered only as a guide.</p>
<p>The struct PxVehicleArrayData is discussed in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#data-layout"><span class="std std-ref">Parameter and State Data Layout</span></a>.</p>

These vehicles have a drivetrain with an engine, clutch, differential and gearing.  The only difference between these two types of vehicle is the way that the differential divides available drive torque between the driven wheels.  From a coding perspective this is simply a choice between PxVehicleMultiwheelDriveDifferentialComponent and PxVehicleFourWheelDriveDifferentialComponent, as illustrated in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#legacy-vehicle-types"><span class="std std-ref">Legacy Vehicle Types</span></a>. The snippet introduces an enumerated list of differential types that readily allows different differentials to be applied:</p>

<p>Tanks have a couple of unique features not shared with any other vehicle type.  The first unique feature is that a tank is controlled with two thrust levers and two brake levers.  The second unique feature is that a tank’s component sequence employs the class PxVehicleTankDriveDifferentialComponent.  This component reads the multiple thrust lever inputs and uses them to compute the division of drive and brake torque between the left and right tank tracks.</p>

<p>SnippetVehicleMultiThreading desmonstrates how to simulate vehicles across multiple threads. A key feature of this snippet is the way that the components PxVehiclePhysXActorBeginComponent and PxVehiclePhysXActorEndComponent are managed in a multi-threaded environment.  These components perform read/writes to/from the  PxRigidBody that represents the vehicle in the PhysX scene.  It is not possible to perform simultaneous reads and writes to actors in the same PhysX scene from multiple threads. With this in mind, the PxVehiclePhysXActorBeginComponent and PxVehiclePhysXActorEndComponent instances of each vehicle are gathered in arrays and updated sequentially from the same thread. The  remaining component sequences are thread-safe and may be executed in parallel across multiple threads.</p>

The custom component is added to the vehicle’s component sequence as an alternative to PxVehicleSuspensionComponent.</p>

<section id="snippetvehicletruck">
<span id="snippets-truck"></span><h3>SnippetVehicleTruck<a class="headerlink" href="#snippetvehicletruck" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>SnippetVehicleTruck desmonstrates the simulation of jointed chains of vehicles. The example here is a four-wheeled tractor pulling a four-wheeled trailer.  The wheels of the tractor respond to brake, throttle and steer commands.  The trailer is considered to have no drivetrain and no steering column so the wheels only respond to brake commands.</p>
<p>The sticky tire state, as discussed in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#physx-scene-constraint"><span class="std std-ref">PxVehiclePhysXConstraintComponent</span></a>, presents a challenge for multi-vehicle simulation.  When vehicles approach the rest state, the tire model is swapped for a special low speed model that brings the vehicle gently to rest using velocity constraints instead of tire forces.  These velocity constraints are released as soon as an intention to accelerate is signalled by applying a non-zero drive torque to any wheel.  The challenge with jointed chains of vehicles is that typically only a single vehicle in the chain responds to throttle commands.  If the entire ensemble is brought to rest with velocity constraints then only a single vehicle will have those constraints cleared when a throttle command is issued. The ensemble will stubbornly remain locked in place.  The solution to this is to communicate the intention to accelerate to all vehicles in the chain.  This is achieved with the helper functions:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The idea here is that the intention to accelerate is encoded in the actuation states of the vehicle that is driving the ensemble.  When an intention to accelerate is determined, that intention is passed to all other vehicles in the chain by releasing any sticky tire constraints that might be activated.</p>
<p>Many update orders are possible.  If all vehicles are simulated in sequence on a single thread then the following pseudo-code serves as an example:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="k">const</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="kt">bool</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">intentionToAccelerate</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">PxVehicleAccelerationIntentCompute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">tractor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">axleDescription</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">tractor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">actuationStates</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">PxVehicleTireStickyStateReset</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">intentionToAccelerate</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">trailer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">axleDescription</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">trailer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">tireStickyStates</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">tractor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">simulate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dt</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="n">trailer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">simulate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dt</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The above example uses the actuation state of the tractor at the previous timestep to reset the tire sticky state at the next timestep.  An alternative update order removes  this latency:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">tractor</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">simulate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dt</span><span class="p">);</span>

<span class="n">trailer</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">simulate</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">dt</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If the vehicles of the chain are to be simulated in parallel on multiple threads then, in the absence of locks imposing an execution order, it is necessary to accept the latency:</p>

<p>thresholdForwardSpeedForWheelAngleIntegration:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Wheel rotation speed can often become oscillatory and unstable at low forward speeds, particularly when the vehicle approaches the rest state under damping forces.  Larger timesteps tend to aggravate the instability, while larger wheel moments of inertia tend to bring the simulation back into a stable regime. To disguise the instability in wheel rotation speed at low forward speed, a blend between the rolling speed of the wheel (the rotational speed that results in zero longitudinal slip) and the actual rotation speed is performed.  This blended rotational speed is used only to forward integrate the accumulated rotational angle of the wheel.  The blend is only performed when the longitudinal speed at the wheel is smaller than thresholdForwardSpeedForWheelAngleIntegration.  Larger timesteps typically require larger threshold speeds.</p>

A value in radians equivalent to somewhere between 30 degrees and 90 degrees seems like a good starting point but it really depends on the vehicle being simulated.  Larger values of max steer will result in tighter turns, while smaller values will result in wider turns.  Be aware, though, that large steer angles at large speeds are likely to result in the car losing traction and spinning out of control, just as would happen with a real car.  A good way to avoid this is to filter the steer angles passed to the car at run-time to generate smaller steer angles at larger speeds.

<p>This is used by direct and engine drive models to specify suspension compliance.  Suspension compliance is the effect that suspension compression has on other properties of vehicle handling such as toe angle, camber angle and suspension force application point.</p>
<p>The compliance system is built on the concept of normalised compression, which is defined to be ratio of current compression and the maximum compression, as specified by PxVehicleSuspensionParams::suspensionTravelDist.  A normalised compression of 0 corresponds to the suspension at maximum elongation, while a normalised compression of 1 corresponds to the suspension at maximum compression.</p>
<p>The supported properties are as follows:</p>

</div>
<p>The compliance system allows a graph of up to 3 points to be specified for each supported property.  An empty graph indicates that suspension compliance has no impact on the relevant property. A graph with a single point indicates that compliance is a constant value independent of suspension compression.  A graph with two points indicates a linear relationship between compliance and the relevant property. Finally, a graph with 3 points allows the relationship to be specified as a piecewise polynomial with two segements.</p>
<section id="toe-angle">
<h4>Toe Angle<a class="headerlink" href="#toe-angle" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>The yaw angle of any wheel arises from the response to the steer command, Ackermann correction to the command response and toe angle. More specifically, the toe angle is added to the post-Ackermann yaw angle to compute an instantaneous yaw angle for the wheel that is used for the remainder of the vehicle update. If no steer command is applied then the yaw angle of the wheel is equal to the toe angle.</p>
<p>The toe angle can be used to help the car straighten up after coming out of a turn.  This is a good number to experiment with but is best left at 0 unless detailed tweaks are required.</p>
<p>To help the car straighten up apply a small negative angle to one of the front wheels and a small positive angle to the other front wheel. By choosing which wheel takes the positive angles, and which the negative, it is straightforward to make the wheels either “toe-in” or “toe-out”.  A “toe-in” configuration, the front wheels pointing slightly towards each other, should help the car straighten up after a turn but at the expense of making it a little harder to turn in the first place.  A “toe-out” configuration can have the opposite effect.  Toe angles greater than a few degrees are best avoided.</p>

<section id="camber-angle">
<h4>Camber Angle<a class="headerlink" href="#camber-angle" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>It is typical for the wheels of extended springs to camber inward; that is, the left and right wheels almost seem to form the edges of a V shape when viewed from the front or rear along the forward axis of the vehicle.  Compressed springs, on the other hand, typically camber outwards; that is, they almost form the outer edges of an A shape when viewed from the front or rear along the forward axis of the vehicle.</p>
<p>The camber angle is accounted for when projecting the wheel’s orientation (in the world frame) onto the ground plane.  This projection is used to compute an instantaneous camber angle that is forwarded to the tire force computation.</p>
</section>
<section id="suspension-force-application-point">
<h4>Suspension Force Application Point<a class="headerlink" href="#suspension-force-application-point" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h4>
<p>This is the application point of the suspension force, expressed as an offset vector from the suspension frame.</p>
<p>In a real vehicle the suspension forces are mediated through the suspension strut. These are often incredibly complex mechanical systems that are computationally expensive to simulate. As a consequence, instead of modeling the details of the suspension strut, it makes sense to assume that the suspension strut has an effective point at which it applies the force to the rigid body. Choosing that point, however, needs careful consideration. At the same time, it opens up all sorts of tweaking possibilities, freed from the constraints of the real world.</p>
<p>Deciding on the suspension force application point requires some thought.  Consider a line starting at suspension maximum compression and directed along the suspension travel direction. The application point is likely somewhere along this line. For a standard 4-wheeled car it makes sense that the application point is somewhere above the wheel center but below the center of mass of the rigid body. It is probably above the wheel center because the suspension is mostly above this point. It can be assumed that it is somewhere below the rigid body center of mass because otherwise vehicles would lean out of the turn rather than in to the turn. This narrows down the application point to really quite a small section of a known line.</p>
<p>When editing the suspension force application point it is important to bear in mind that lowering the app point too far will result in cars leaning more into the turn. This can have a negative effect on handling because the inner wheel can take so much load that the response saturates, while the outer wheel ends up with reduced load and reduced turning force. The result is poor cornering. Conversely, setting the app point too high will result in cornering that looks unnatural. The aim is to achieve a good balance.</p>

<p>sprungMass:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is the mass that is supported by the suspension spring.</p>
<p>A vehicle with rigid body center of mass at the center of the four wheels would typically be equally supported by each of the suspension springs; that is, each suspension spring supports 1/4 of the total vehicle mass. If the center of mass was moved forward then it would be expected that the front wheels would need to support more mass than the rear wheels.  Conversely, a center of mass nearer the rear wheels ought to result in the rear suspension springs supporting more mass than at the front.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In order to achieve stability at the desired rest pose it is recommended that the collection of sprung masses matches the mass and center of mass of the rigid body.  There are two strategies that can be employed to achieve this.  The first approach is to decide upon values for the individual sprung masses and work forwards to compute an equivalent value for the rigid body mass and center of mass.  More specifically, the rigid body mass and center of mass can be computed using the equations presented in Section <a class="reference internal" href="#mechanical-model"><span class="std std-ref">Mechanical Model</span></a> and then applied to the vehicle’s rigid body parameters.  The second approach starts with the rigid body mass and center of mass of the vehicle’s rigid body and works backwards to compute and set the sprung masses.  This makes use of the helper function PxVehicleComputeSprungMasses.</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>stiffness:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This value describes the strength of the suspension spring.  The spring strength has a profound influence on handling by modulating the time it takes for the vehicle to respond to bumps in the road and on the amount of load experienced by the tire.</p>
<p>Key to understanding the effect of spring stiffness is the concept of a spring’s natural frequency.  Consider a simple spring system, such as a pendulum swinging back and forth.  The number of trips per second that the pendulum makes from full left to full right and then back again is called the natural frequency of the pendulum.  A more powerful pendulum spring will result in the pendulum swinging faster, thereby increasing the natural frequency.  Conversely, increasing the pendulum mass will result in a slower oscillation, thereby reducing the natural frequency.</p>
<p>In the context of a suspension spring supporting a fixed portion of vehicle mass, the strength of the spring will affect the natural frequency; that is, the rate at which the spring can respond to changes in load distribution.  Consider a car taking a corner.  As the car corners it leans in to the turn, putting more weight on the suspensions on the outside of the turn. The speed at which the spring reacts by applying forces to redistribute the load is controlled by the natural frequency. Very high natural frequencies, such as those on a racing car, will naturally produce twitchy handling because the load on the tires, and therefore the forces they can generate, is varying very rapidly.  Very low natural frequencies, on the other hand, will result in the car taking a long time to straighten up even after the turn is complete. This will produce sluggish and unresponsive handling.</p>
<p>Another effect of strength and and natural frequency is the response of a car to a bump in the road.  High natural frequencies can result in the car responding very strongly and quickly to the bump, with the wheel possibly even leaving the road for a short while.  This not only creates a bumpy ride but also periods of time when the tire is generating no forces.  Weaker springs will result in a smoother trip over the bump, with weaker but more constant tire forces.  A balance must be found to tune the car for the expected types of turn and terrain.</p>
<p>The natural frequency of the spring presents a challenge for computer simulation.  A smooth and stable simulation requires that the spring is updated at a frequency much greater than the spring’s natural frequency.  An alternative way of expressing this is to consider the period of the spring relative to the timestep of the simulation.  The period of the spring is the time the spring takes to complete a single oscillation, and is mathematically equal to the reciprocal of the natural frequency.  In order to achieve a stable simulation the spring must be sampled at several points during each oscillation.  A natural consequence of this observation is that the simulation timestep must be significantly smaller than the period of the spring.  To discuss this further it is helpful to introduce a ratio that describes the number of simulation updates that will occur during each spring oscillation.  This ratio is simply the spring period divided by the timestep:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">alpha</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sqrt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">sprungMass</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">stiffness</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="n">timestep</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>where sqrt(sprungMass/stiffness) is the period of the spring.  An alpha value of 1.0 means that the chosen timestep and spring properties only allow a single sample of the spring during each oscillation.  As described above, this is almost guaranteed to produce unstable behavior.  In fact, the argument presented so far suggests a value of alpha significantly greater than 1.0 is essential to produce a smooth simulation.  The exact value of alpha at which stability emerges is very difficult to predict and depends on many other parameters.  As a guide, however, it is recommended that the timestep and spring properties are chosen so that they produce an alpha value greater than 5.0; that is, a minimum of five simulation updates per spring cycle.</p>
<p>When tuning a suspension spring it can be very useful to use manufacturer data to discover typical values used across a range of vehicle types.  This data is not always readily available.  An alternative strategy would be to think in terms of the natural frequency of the spring by imagining how quickly the car would oscillate up and down if it was dropped onto the ground from a height of, say, 0.5m.  The springs of a typical family car have natural frequency somewhere between 5 and 10; that is, such a car would make 5-10 oscillations per second if gently dropped to the ground.  If the mass supported by the spring is already known then the spring strength can be calculated from the following equation:</p>

<p>damping:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This describes the rate at which the spring dissipates the energy stored in the spring.</p>
<p>Key to the understanding of damping rate are the concepts of under-damping, over-damping, and critical damping.  An over-damped pendulum displaced from rest is unable to make a single back-and-forth trip before it dissipates all its energy, while an under-damped pendulum would be able to make at least a single back-and-forth trip.  A critically damped pendulum makes exactly a single back-and-forth trip before expending all its energy.</p>
<p>For vehicle suspension springs, it is typically important to make sure that the spring has a damper rate that produces over-damping but not by too much.  When cornering, for example, it is important that the spring doesn’t over-respond by shifting the weight from the left suspension to the right suspension then back again.  If this happened the tire load, and the forces generated, would be extremely variable, resulting in twitchy and uncontrollable handling. A very heavily over-damped spring, on the other hand, will feel sluggish and unresponsive.</p>
<p>The concept of critical damping can be used to help tune the damping rate of the spring.  It is helpful to introduce a value known as the damping ratio, which helps to mathematically describe the under-damping, critical damping and over-damping regimes:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">dampingRatio</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">damping</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sqrt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stiffness</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sprungMass</span><span class="p">)]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A dampingRatio with value greater than 1.0 produces over-damping, a value of exactly 1.0 generates critical damping, and a value less than 1.0 is under-damped.  It can be useful to first think about whether the spring will be under-damped or over-damped, then think about how far it will be from critical damping.  This process allows a number to be subjectively applied to the damping ratio.  From here the damping rate can be directly computed by rearranging the equation above:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">damping</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">dampingRatio</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sqrt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stiffness</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">sprungMass</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>A typical family car is probably slightly over-damped, having dampingRatio with value perhaps just over 1.0. A guideline would be that values very far from critical damping are likely to be unrealistic and will either produce sluggish or twitchy handling. It is difficult to put an exact figure on this but somewhere between 0.8 and 1.2 seems like a good starting point for the damping ratio.</p>

<p>This is used by direct and engine drive models to specify an anti-roll or anti-pitch bar.</p>
<p>When a vehicle takes a corner the turning force causes the car to roll.  Typically, the suspension springs on the outside of the turn are compressed while the suspension springs on the inside of the turn are elongated.  If the roll is so severe that the inside wheels completely leave the ground then there is a danger that the driver will lose control of the vehicle.  In such cases, there is even a danger that the vehicle will rotate onto its side.   For less severe rolls there still remains a handling problem that arises from the distribution of load between the inside and outside tires.  The issue here is that the imbalance of the vehicle can lead to under-steer or over-steer.</p>
<p>Anti-roll bars are commonly used to reduce the roll that naturally occurs when cornering.  They typically work as a torsion spring that applies a torque in order to minimise the difference in spring displacement for a pair of wheels.  A standard family car might feature a front and rear anti-roll bar.  The front bar applies a torque to reduce the difference between the front-left and front-right wheels.  Similarly, the rear bar applies a torque to reduce the difference between the rear-left and rear-right wheels.</p>
<p>The magnitude of the anti-roll torque is proportional to the difference in spring displacement of the two wheels that are connected by the bar.  The magnitude is also proportional to a stiffness parameter:  stiffer bars generate more anti-roll torque.</p>
<p>As a general rule, under-steer can be reduced by increasing the stiffness of the rear anti-roll bar.  Increasing the stiffness of the front anti-roll bar typically reduces over-steer.</p>

<span id="tuning-guide-tire-force"></span><h3>PxVehicleTireForceParams<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehicletireforceparams" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is used by direct and engine drive models to specify the conversion of tire slip to tire force.</p>
<p>The tire force computation is performed in two conceptual stages.  The first stage of the computation independently computes the lateral and longitudinal components of the force using linear equations.  These independent forces are computed by treating the tire as a linear system so that the force in each direction can be theoretically viewed as the product of a tire strength per unit slip and the slippage experienced by the tire. The second stage of the computation applies the rule that the combined tire force is limited by the product of the tire load and friction.  Just as with rigid bodies, tires are able to resist greater horizontal forces when they experience a large normal load on a surface with high friction value. With this in mind the maximum resistance force for a tire can be approximated as the product of the normal load and the friction value.  The default PhysX Vehicle tire model employs a series of smoothing functions to implement the normalization of the combined tire forces.</p>
<p>In addition to the lateral and longitudinal components of force, a camber thrust force, arising from the camber angle of the tire, is also computed.  Typically, this provides only a small correction to the effect of the lateral and longitudinal components.  The camber force participates in the normalization process.</p>
<p>The following tire parameters describe the computation of the independent lateral and longitudinal and camber components; that is, the first conceptual stage of the force computation.  Reference is made throughout to the handling consequences of the normalization process.</p>
<p>longStiff:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The longitudinal tire force is approximately the product of the longitudinal stiffness and the longitudinal slip:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">longitudinalTireForce</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">longStiff</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">*</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="n">longitudinalSlip</span><span class="p">;</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Increasing this value will result in the tire attempting to generate more longitudinal force when the tire is slipping.  Typically, increasing longitudinal stiffness will help the car accelerate and brake.  The total tire force available is limited by the load on the tire so be aware that increases in this value might have no effect or even come at the expense of reduced lateral force.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>latStiffX:</p>
<p>latStiffY:</p>
<p>restLoad:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>These values together describe the lateral stiffness per unit lateral slip of the tire.  The lateral stiffness of a tire has a role similar to the longitudinal stiffness (longStiff), except that it governs the development of lateral tire forces, and is a function of tire load. Typically, increasing lateral stiffness will help the car turn more quickly.  The total tire force available is limited by the load on the tire so be aware that increases in this value might have no effect or even come at the expense of reduced longitudinal force.</p>
<p>Lateral stiffness is a little more complicated than longitudinal stiffness because tires typically provide poor response under heavy load.  Typical for car tires is a graph of lateral force against load that has linear response close to zero load but saturates at greater loads.  This means that at low tire loads the lateral stiffness has a linear response to load; that is, more load results in more stiffness and more lateral(turning) force.  At higher tire loads the tire has a saturated response and is in a regime where applying more load will not result in more tire stiffness.  In this latter regime it would be expected that the tire would start slipping.</p>
<p>The combination of two values latStiffX and latStiffY describe a graph of lateral stiffness as a function of normalized tire load.  The tire force computation employs a smoothing function that requires knowledge of the normalized tire load at which the tire has a saturated response to tire load along with the lateral stiffness that occurs at this saturation point.  A typical curve can be seen in the graph below.</p>
<p>The parameter latStiffX describes the normalized tire load above which the tire has a saturated response to tire load. The normalized tire load is simply the tire load divided by the load that is experienced when the vehicle is perfectly at rest.  A value of 2 for latStiffX, for example, means that when the the tire has a load more than twice its rest load it can deliver no more lateral stiffness no matter how much extra load is applied to the tire.  In the graph below latStiffX has value 3.</p>
<p>The parameter latStiffY describes the maximum stiffness per unit lateral slip.  The maximum stiffness is delivered when the tire is in the saturated load regime, governed in turn by latStiffX.  In the graph below, latStiffY has value 100000.</p>
<p>The computation of the lateral stiffness begins by computing the load on the tire and then computing the normalized load in order to compute the number of rest loads experienced by the tire.  This places the tire somewhere along the X-axis of the graph below.  The corresponding value on the Y-axis of the curve parameterized by latStiffX and latStiffY is queried to provide the lateral stiffness. This final value describes the lateral stiffness per unit lateral slip.</p>
<img alt="../_images/VehicleLateralStiffnessVsNormaliaedLoad.png" src="../_images/VehicleLateralStiffnessVsNormaliaedLoad.png" />
<p>A good starting value for latStiffX is somewhere between 2 and 3.  A good starting value for mLatStiffY is around 100000.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>camberStiff:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Camber stiffness is analogous to the longitudinal and lateral stiffness, except that it describes the camber thrust force arising per unit camber angle (in radians).  The independent camber force is computed as the camber angle multiplied by the camber stiffness:</p>

</pre></div>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>frictionVsSlip:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><p>These six values describe a graph of friction as a function of longitudinal slip.  Vehicle tires have a complicated response to longitudinal slip.  This graph attempts to approximate this relationship.</p>
<p>Typically, tires have a linear response at small slips.  This means that when the tire is only slightly slipping it is able to generate a response force that grows as the slip increases.   At greater values of slip, the force can actually start to decrease from the peak value that occurs at the optimum slip.  Beyond the optimum slip the tire eventually starts behaving less and less efficiently and hits a plateau of inefficiency.</p>
<p>The friction value for the combination of surface type and tire type is stored in the value PxVehicleRoadGeometryState::friction.  The graph of friction versus longitudinal slip is used as a correction.  In particular, a final friction value is computed from the product of PxVehicleRoadGeometryState::friction and the value taken from the friction vs slip graph.  The tire model then responds to the final friction value.</p>
<p>The first two values describe the friction at zero tire slip: frictionVsSlip[0][0] = 0, and frictionVsSlip[0][1] = friction at zero slip.</p>
<p>The next two values describe the optimum slip and the friction at the optimum slip:  frictionVsSlip[1][0] = optimum slip, frictionVsSlip[1][1] = friction at optimum slip.</p>
<p>The last two values describe the slip at which the plateau of inefficiency begins and the value of the friction available at the plateau of inefficiency: frictionVsSlip[2][0] = slip at the start of the plateau of inefficiency, frictionVsSlip[2][1] = the friction available at the plateau of inefficiency.</p>
<p>In the graph below the following values have been used:</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[0][0] = 0.0</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[0][1] = 0.4</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[1][0] = 0.5</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[1][1] = 1.0</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[2][0] = 0.75</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[2][1] = 0.60</p>
</div></blockquote>
<img alt="../_images/FrictionVsSlip.png" src="../_images/FrictionVsSlip.png" />
<p>The friction values described here are used to scale the friction of the ground surface.  This means they should be in range (0,1) but this is not a strict requirement.  Typically, the friction from the graph would be close to 1.0 in order to provide a small correction to the ground surface friction.</p>
<p>A good starting point for this is a flat graph of friction vs slip with these values:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>frictionVsSlip[0][0]=0.0</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[0][1]=1.0</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[1][0]=0.5</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[1][1]=1.0</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[2][0]=1.0</p>
<p>frictionVsSlip[2][1]=1.0</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p>loadFilter:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>This is for very fine control of the handling, and corrects numerical issues inherent in simulations at large timesteps.</p>
<p>At large simulation timesteps the amplitude of motion of the suspension springs is larger than it would be in real-life.  This is unfortunately unavoidable. On a bumpy surface this could mean that the simulation lifts the car further from the ground than would really happen.  This could be quickly followed by the spring being more compressed than would be experienced with a real vehicle.  A consequence of this oscillation is that the load on the tire is more variable than expected, and the available tire forces have more variability than expected.  This filter aims to correct this numerical problem by smoothing the tire load with the aim of making the handling smoother and more predictable.</p>
<p>A key concept is that of normalized tire loads.  A normalized tire load is just the actual load divided by the load experienced when the vehicle is in its rest configuration.  If a tire experiences more load than it does at rest then it has a normalized tire load greater than 1.0.  Similarly, if a tire has less load than it does at rest then it has a normalized tire load less than 1.0.  At rest, all tires obviously have a normalized tire load of exactly 1.0.  The normalized tire load can never be less than zero.</p>
<p>The values here describe points on a 2d graph that generates filtered tire loads from raw tire loads.  The x-axis of the graph is “normalized tire load”, while the y-axis of the graph is “filtered normalized tire load”.  The values loadFilter[0][0] and loadFilter[1][0] are respectively the x-coordinates of the beginnng and end of the linear portion of the graph.  The values loadFilter[0][1] and loadFilter[1][1] are respectively the y-coordinates of the beginning and end of the linear portion of the graph.</p>
<p>Normalized loads less than loadFilter[0][0] produce a filtered normalized load of loadFilter[0][1].  Normalized loads greater than loadFilter[1][0] produce a filtered normalized load of loadFilter[1][1].  Loads in-between loadFilter[0][0] and loadFilter[1][0] produce a filtered normalized load in-between loadFilter[1][0] and loadFilter[1][1], as computed by direct interpolation.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><img alt="../_images/FilteredLoad.png" src="../_images/FilteredLoad.png" />
<p>Choosing loadFilter[1][0] and loadFilter[1][1] limits the maximum load that will ever be used in the simulation.  On the other hand, choosing loadFilter[0][0]&gt;0 and/or loadFilter[0][1]&gt;0 allows the tire to potentially generate a non-zero tire force even when the tire is just touching the ground at maximum droop.</p>
<p>The filtered load can be made identical to the computed tire load by setting:</p>
<div class="highlight-c++ notranslate"><div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="n">loadFilter</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="n">loadFilter</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">][</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">]</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="mi">0</span>

</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Tires may only generate forces if the tire is touching the ground: if the tire cannot be placed on the ground then the tire force is always of zero magnitude.  A tire touching the ground at maximum suspension droop, on the other hand, has zero measured load because the spring generates zero force at maximum droop.  By editing loadFilter it is possible to generate tire forces even when there is very little load actually acting on the tire.</p>

<p>However, this is only a rough guide.  Tweaking each value will modify the motion around the corresponding axis, with higher values making it harder to induce rotational speed from tire and suspension forces.</p>

<div><p>Each gear requires a gearing ratio.  Higher gear ratios result in more torque but lower top speed in that gear.  Typically, the higher the gear, the lower the gear ratio.

<p>switchTime:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The switch time describes how long it takes (in seconds) for a gear change to be completed.  It is impossible to change gear immediately in a real car.

A good trick might be to penalize players that use an automatic gear box by increasing the gear switch time.</p>
<p>If the autobox is enabled it is a good idea to set this value significantly lower than PxVehicleAutoboxParams::latency.  If the autobox latency is smaller than the gear switch time then the autobox might decide to initiate a downwards gear change immediately after an upward gear shift has been completed.  This situation can leave the car cycling between neutral and first gear with very short interludes in 2nd gear.</p>

<p>The autobox initiates gear changes up or down based on the rotation speed of the engine.

The autobox only initiates gear changes upward or downwards a single gear at a time.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that if the autobox initiates a gear change then the accelerator pedal is automatically disconnected from the engine for the entire duration of the gear change.  Manual gear changes are not subject to this limitation.  This is in keeping with typical real-world autobox behavior.  The idea behind this is to stop the engine wildly accelerating during the neutral phase of the gear change, thereby avoiding damaging clutch slip when the clutch re-engages at the end of the gear change.</p>

<p>This value is to be edited only for very fine tweaking of the vehicle.  Some clutch slip can be attributed to the numerical issues in the simulation at large timesteps, while some is a natural consequence of driving the car in an overly aggressive manner.

<p>This is used by engine drive models to specify the computational method used to resolve the coupling between engine and wheels.</p>
<p>PxVehicleClutchParams specifies the algorithm employed to resolve the differential equations that couple engine and wheels.  If the wheel count is large, the computation corresponding to PxVehicleClutchAccuracyMode::eBEST_POSSIBLE becomes expensive and it could be beneficial to use PxVehicleClutchAccuracyMode::eESTIMATE instead. If estimation mode is selected then the parameter PxVehicleClutchAccuracyMode::estimateIterations may be used to control the trade-off of computational effort and performance.</p>
<p>As a guide, it is recommended  to use PxVehicleClutchAccuracyMode::eBEST_POSSIBLE for a vehicle with four wheels connected to the differential.  At the other end of the spectrum, a truck with 20 wheels connected to the drivetrain will require PxVehicleClutchAccuracyMode::eESTIMATE.</p>

<p>This is used by engine drive models to specify a differential that distributes drive torque to each wheel using a constant multiplier.  It also describes the contribution that each wheel makes to the averaged rotational speed of the wheel-side clutch plate.</p>
<p>torqueRatios:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>For a four-wheeled vehicle, front(rear) wheel drive may be implemented by applying 0.5 to both front(rear) wheels. Alternatively, drive torque may be deliverd to all wheels of a vehicle. For a four-wheeled vehicle this would require a value of 0.25 to be applied to both front and both rear wheels. The sum of all entries in the torqueRatios must add up to 1.0.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>aveWheelSpeedRatios:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The clutch is modelled as two spinning plates with one plate connected to the engine and the other connected to the wheels. The torque delivered to the wheels is proportional to the rotational speed difference between the two plates. The rotational speed of wheel-side clutch plate is computed as a weighted average with the weights governed by the array aveWheelSpeedRatios.   A good starting point is to set each entry in aveWheelSpeedRatios to be the same as the equivalent entry in the torqueRatios array.</p>

<span id="tuning-guide-four-wheel-diff"></span><h3>PxVehicleFourWheelDriveDifferentialParams<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehiclefourwheeldrivedifferentialparams" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is used by engine drive models to specify a differential that distributes torques to wheels with the caveat that specified pairs of wheels obey a rule that their rotational speed ratio never exceeds a configurable differential bias.</p>
<p>PxVehicleFourWheelDriveDifferentialParams performs the same role as PxVehicleMultiWheelDriveDifferentialParams but with the option to turn it into a limited slip differential.  The limited slip differential imposes limits on the ratio of wheel rotational speed when considering pairs of wheels.  The class PxVehicleFourWheelDriveDifferentialParams introduces the vocabulary of front wheels and rear wheels. A maximum ratio may be specified for a pair of wheels specified as front wheels.  Equally, a maximum  ratio may be specified for a pair of wheels specified as rear wheels. Finally, a maximum ratio may be specified for the front wheel pair relative to the rear wheel pair.</p>
<p>In the absence of any breach of a slip limit, drive torque is distributed to the wheels as specified in the torqueRatios array.  Beyond the slip limit, torque is diverted from one wheel of a limited slip pair to the other.</p>
<p>frontWheelIds[2]:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The array frontWheelIds specifies the two wheels considered by the limited slip differential as front wheels.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>rearWheelIds[2]:</p>

</div></blockquote>
<p>frontBias:</p>
<p>rearBias:</p>
<p>centerBias:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The effect of the limited slip differential is to impose a maximum ratio of wheel rotational speed between pairs of wheel.  The parameter frontBias is the maximum allowed for the front wheels, while rearBias is the maximum allowed for the rear wheels.  The parameter centerBias is the ratio for the front wheel pair relative to the rear wheel pair.  A value of 1.3 is a good starting point for any bias.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p>frontTarget:</p>
<p>rearTarget:</p>
<p>centerTarget:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>If any wheel pair exceeds its bias, the differential will seek to resolve the discrepancy between the current ratio and the specified bias. A problem may arise if the limited slip only just fails to resolve the discrepancy.  If this happens, the bias will be breached at the next simulation step and perhaps the next and so on. To avoid this, the differential sets a target rotational speed ratio that is just less than the complementary bias.  When the target is much less than the bias it is likely that an oscillation will result with the amplitude of oscillation being proportional to the difference between target and bias. The ideal outcome is a target that does not result in obvious oscillation but also resolves the bias breach without getting stuck in a phase of continual resolution.  A value of 1.29 is a good starting point, assuming a bias of 1.3.</p>

<h3>PxVehicleTankDriveDifferentialParams<a class="headerlink" href="#pxvehicletankdrivedifferentialparams" title="Link to this heading">#</a></h3>
<p>This is used by engine drive models to implement a tank differential.  The tank differential is designed to deliver torque to the wheels on each tank track in such a way that wheels sharing a tank also share a rotational speed.</p>
<p>The only difference between PxVehicleTankDriveDifferentialParams and PxVehicleMultiwheelDriveDifferentialParams is that PxVehicleTankDriveDifferentialParams requires the wheels on each tank track to be configured.  Multiple tank tracks are allowed and each may be linked to a left or right thrust lever.</p>
<p>A wheel on a tank may be added to a track or it may be modelled as a normal wheel that is either connected to the differential or not.  Any wheel on a tank may be steered. It is, however, unusual to steer any wheel on a tank track because tank steering is typically achieved by asymmetrically distributing drive and brake torque.</p>

<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><p>Does the vehicle cycle between first gear and neutral? If the autobox is enabled then the problem is probably that the latency of the autobox is shorter than the time spent performing a gear change.  The autobox latency controls the minimum time spent in-between automated gear changes.  After an automated gear change is initiated the autobox will not make another gear change decision until the latency time has passed.  During a gear change the vehicle enters neutral gear and the accelerator pedal is uncoupled from the engine, meaning that the engine will slow down during the gear change.  When the vehicle enters the target gear at the end of the gear change the autobox might decide immediately that the engine is too slow for the target gear and immediately initiate a downwards gear change.  This will immediately put the car back in neutral, meaning that the car spends a very long time in neutral and never reaches its target gear.  This will not happen if the autobox latency is set significantly larger than the gear switch time.</p></li>
