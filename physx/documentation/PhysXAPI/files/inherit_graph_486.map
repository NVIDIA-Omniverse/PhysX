<area shape="rect" id="node1" href="$structPxVehicleClutchParams.html" title="The clutch connects two plates together. One plate rotates with the speed of the engine. The second plate rotates with a weighted average of all wheels connected to the differential after accounting for the gear ratio. The difference in rotation speeds generates a restoring torque applied to engine and wheels that aims to reduce the difference in rotational speed. The restoring torque is proportional to the clutch strength and the clutch pedal position. " alt="" coords="5,5,168,32"/>
