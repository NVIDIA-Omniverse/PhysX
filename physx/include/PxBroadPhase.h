	\brief Broad phase algorithm used in the simulation

	eSAP is a good generic choice with great performance when many objects are sleeping. Performance
	can degrade significantly though, when all objects are moving, or when large numbers of objects
	are added to or removed from the broad phase. This algorithm does not need world bounds to be
	defined in order to work.

	eMBP is an alternative broad phase algorithm that does not suffer from the same performance
	issues as eSAP when all objects are moving or when inserting large numbers of objects. However
	its generic performance when many objects are sleeping might be inferior to eSAP, and it requires
	users to define world bounds in order to work.

	eABP is a revisited implementation of MBP, which automatically manages broad-phase regions.
	It offers the convenience of eSAP (no need to define world bounds or regions) and the performance
	of eMBP when a lot of objects are moving. While eSAP can remain faster when most objects are
	sleeping and eMBP can remain faster when it uses a large number of properly-defined regions,
	eABP often gives the best performance on average and the best memory usage.

	eGPU is a GPU implementation of the incremental sweep and prune approach. Additionally, it uses a ABP-style
	initial pair generation approach to avoid large spikes when inserting shapes. It not only has the advantage 
	of traditional SAP approch which is good for when many objects are sleeping, but due to being fully parallel, 
	it also is great when lots of shapes are moving or for runtime pair insertion and removal. It can become a 
	performance bottleneck if there are a very large number of shapes roughly projecting to the same values
	on a given axis. If the scene has a very large number of shapes in an actor, e.g. a humanoid, it is recommended
	to use an aggregate to represent multi-shape or multi-body actors to minimize stress placed on the broad phase.

	\brief Broad-phase callback to receive broad-phase related events.

	Each broadphase callback object is associated with a PxClientID. It is possible to register different
	callbacks for different clients. The callback functions are called this way:
	- for shapes/actors, the callback assigned to the actors' clients are used
	- for aggregates, the callbacks assigned to clients from aggregated actors  are used

	\note SDK state should not be modified from within the callbacks. In particular objects should not
	be created or destroyed. If state modification is needed then the changes should be stored to a buffer
	and performed after the simulation step.

	<b>Threading:</b> It is not necessary to make this class thread safe as it will only be called in the context of the
	user thread.

	\brief "Region of interest" for the broad-phase.

	This is currently only used for the PxBroadPhaseType::eMBP broad-phase, which requires zones or regions to be defined
	when the simulation starts in order to work. Regions can overlap and be added or removed at runtime, but at least one
	region needs to be defined when the scene is created.

	If objects that do no overlap any region are inserted into the scene, they will not be added to the broad-phase and
	thus collisions will be disabled for them. A PxBroadPhaseCallback out-of-bounds notification will be sent for each one
	of those objects.

	The total number of regions is limited by PxBroadPhaseCaps::maxNbRegions.

	The number of regions has a direct impact on performance and memory usage, so it is recommended to experiment with
	various settings to find the best combination for your game. A good default setup is to start with global bounds
	around the whole world, and subdivide these bounds into 4*4 regions. The PxBroadPhaseExt::createRegionsFromWorldBounds
	function can do that for you.
