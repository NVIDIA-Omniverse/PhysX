	// PT: we build the new tree over a number of frames/states, in order to limit perf spikes in 'updatePruningTrees'.
	// The states are as follows:
	//
	// BUILD_NOT_STARTED (1 frame, AABBPruner):
	//
	// This is the initial state, before the new (AABBTree) build even starts. In this frame/state, we perform the AABBPruner-related
	// memory allocations:
	// - the new AABB tree is allocated
	// - the array of cached bounding boxes is allocated and filled
	//
	// BUILD_INIT (1 frame, AABBTree):
	//
	// This is the first frame in which the new tree gets built. It deserves its own special state since various things happen in the
	// first frame, that do no happen in subsequent frames. Basically most initial AABBTree-related allocations happen here (but no
	// build step per se).
	//
	// BUILD_IN_PROGRESS (N frames, AABBTree):
	//
	// This is the core build function, actually building the tree. This should be mostly allocation-free, except here and there when
	// building non-complete trees, and during the last call when the tree is finally built.
	//
	// BUILD_NEW_MAPPING (1 frame, AABBPruner):
	//
	// After the new AABBTree is built, we recreate an AABBTreeUpdateMap for the new tree, and use it to invalidate nodes whose objects
	// have been removed during the build.
	//
	// We need to do that before doing a full refit in the next stage/frame. If we don't do that, the refit code will fetch a wrong box,
	// that may very well belong to an entirely new object.
	//
	// Note that this mapping/update map (mNewTreeMap) is temporary, and only needed for the next stage.
	//
	// BUILD_FULL_REFIT (1 frame, AABBPruner):
	//
	// Once the new update map is available, we fully refit the new tree. AABBs of moved objects get updated. AABBs of removed objects
	// become empty.
	//
	// BUILD_LAST_FRAME (1 frame, AABBPruner):
	//
	// This is an artificial frame used to delay the tree switching code. The switch happens as soon as we reach the BUILD_FINISHED
	// state, but we don't want to execute BUILD_FULL_REFIT and the switch in the same frame. This extra BUILD_LAST_FRAME stage buys
	// us one frame, i.e. we have one frame in which we do BUILD_FULL_REFIT, and in the next frame we'll do both BUILD_LAST_FRAME /
	// BUILD_FINISHED / the switch.
	//
	// BUILD_FINISHED (1 frame, AABBPruner):
	//
	// Several things happen in this 'finalization' frame/stage:
	// - We switch the trees (old one is deleted, cached boxes are deleted, new tree pointer is setup)
	// - A new (final) update map is created (mTreeMap). The map is used to invalidate objects that may have been removed during
	//   the BUILD_NEW_MAPPING and BUILD_FULL_REFIT frames. The nodes containing these removed objects are marked for refit.
	// - Nodes containing objects that have moved during the BUILD_NEW_MAPPING and BUILD_FULL_REFIT frames are marked for refit.
	// - We do a partial refit on the new tree, to take these final changes into account. This small partial refit is usually much
	//   cheaper than the full refit we previously performed here.
	// - We remove old objects from the bucket pruner
	//

	// This class implements the Pruner interface for internal SQ use with some additional specialized functions
	// The underlying data structure is a binary AABB tree
	// AABBPruner supports insertions, removals and updates for dynamic objects
	// The tree is either entirely rebuilt in a single frame (static pruner) or progressively rebuilt over multiple frames (dynamic pruner)
	// The rebuild happens on a copy of the tree
	// the copy is then swapped with current tree at the time commit() is called (only if mBuildState is BUILD_FINISHED),
	// otherwise commit() will perform a refit operation applying any pending changes to the current tree
	// While the tree is being rebuilt a temporary data structure (BucketPruner) is also kept in sync and used to speed up
	// queries on updated objects that are not yet in either old or new tree.
	// The requirements on the order of calls:
	// commit() is required to be called before any queries to apply modifications
	// queries can be issued on multiple threads after commit is called
	// commit, buildStep, add/remove/update have to be called from the same thread or otherwise strictly serialized by external code
	// and cannot be issued while a query is running
