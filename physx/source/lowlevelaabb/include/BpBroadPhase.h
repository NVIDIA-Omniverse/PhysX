	\brief Adds a new broad-phase region.

	The bounds for the new region must be non-empty, otherwise an error occurs and the call is ignored.

	The total number of regions is limited to 256. If that number is exceeded, the call is ignored.

	The newly added region will be automatically populated with already existing SDK objects that touch it, if the
	'populateRegion' parameter is set to true. Otherwise the newly added region will be empty, and it will only be
	populated with objects when those objects are added to the simulation, or updated if they already exist.

	Using 'populateRegion=true' has a cost, so it is best to avoid it if possible. In particular it is more efficient
	to create the empty regions first (with populateRegion=false) and then add the objects afterwards (rather than
	the opposite).

	Objects automatically move from one region to another during their lifetime. The system keeps tracks of what
	regions a given object is in. It is legal for an object to be in an arbitrary number of regions. However if an
	object leaves all regions, or is created outside of all regions, several things happen:
		- collisions get disabled for this object
		- if a PxBroadPhaseCallback object is provided, an "out-of-bounds" event is generated via that callback
		- if a PxBroadPhaseCallback object is not provided, a warning/error message is sent to the error stream

	If an object goes out-of-bounds and user deletes it during the same frame, neither the out-of-bounds event nor the
	error message is generated.

	If an out-of-bounds object, whose collisions are disabled, re-enters a valid broadphase region, then collisions
	are re-enabled for that object.
