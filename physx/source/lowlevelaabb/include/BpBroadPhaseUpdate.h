     /**
	 \brief A structure detailing the changes to the collection of aabbs, whose overlaps are computed in the broadphase.
	 The structure consists of per-object arrays of object bounds and object groups, and three arrays that index
	 into the per-object arrays, denoting the bounds which are to be created, updated and removed in the broad phase.

	 * each entry in the object arrays represents the same shape or aggregate from frame to frame.
	 * each entry in an index array must be less than the capacity of the per-object arrays.
	 * no index value may appear in more than one index array, and may not occur more than once in that array.

	 An index value is said to be "in use" if it has appeared in a created list in a previous update, and has not
	 since occurred in a removed list.

	 \param[in] created an array of indices describing the bounds that must be inserted into the broadphase.
	 Each index in the array must not be in use.

	 \param[in] updated an array of indices (referencing the boxBounds and boxGroups arrays) describing the bounds
	 that have moved since the last broadphase update. Each index in the array must be in use, and each object
	 whose index is in use and whose AABB has changed must appear in the update list.

	 \param[in] removed an array of indices describing the bounds that must be removed from the broad phase. Each index in
	 the array must be in use.

	 \param[in] boxBounds an array of bounds coordinates for the AABBs to be processed by the broadphase.

	 An entry is valid if its values are integer bitwise representations of floating point numbers that satisfy max>min in each dimension,
	 along with a further rule that minima(maxima) must have even(odd) values. 

	 Each entry whose index is either in use or appears in the created array must be valid. An entry whose index is either not in use or
	 appears in the removed array need not be valid.

	 \param[in]  boxGroups an array of group ids, one for each bound, used for pair filtering.  Bounds with the same group id will not be
	 reported as overlap pairs by the broad phase.  Zero is reserved for static bounds.

	 Entries in this array are immutable: the only way to change the group of an object is to remove it from the broad phase and reinsert
	 it at a different index (recall that each index must appear at most once in the created/updated/removed lists).

	 \param[in]  boxesCapacity the length of the boxBounds and boxGroups arrays.
