	\brief The profiling system was setup in the expectation that there would be several
	 systems that each had its own island of profile information.  PhysX, client code,
	 and APEX would be the first examples of these.  Each one of these islands is represented
	 by a profile zone.
	 
	 A profile zone combines a name, a place where all the events coming from its interface
	 can flushed, and a mapping from event number to full event name.
	 	
	 It also provides a top level filtering service where profile events
	 can be filtered by event id.  
	 
	 The profile zone implements a system where if there is no one
	 listening to events it doesn't provide a mechanism to send them.  In this way
	 the event system is short circuited when there aren't any clients.
	 
	 All functions on this interface should be considered threadsafe.
